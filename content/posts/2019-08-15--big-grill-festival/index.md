Today is the first day of the [Big Grill Festival](https://www.biggrillfestival.com/). Usually I never go because it falls on my birthday weekend and I am away. So I went after work to see what it was like and to perv on their braai's.

## Highlights - Lamb Tacos

The Lamb Barbacoa Taco with salsa roja and crema was my favourite dish. Made by Andy Low 'N' Slow, I need to try something similar at some stage.

## Highlights - St Louis Ribs with Cheddar Grits

Close second was the the St Louis Spare Ribs with Green Chilli and Irish Cheddar Grits by Mike Johnson from [Sugarfire Smoke House](https://sugarfiresmokehouse.com/).

I had never had Grits before and never had ribs like these. Really enjoyed it. The grits were amazing and the rib fell off the bone. Impressive grill as well!

## Highlists - Nice Braais

I really enjoyed looking at what braai (grills) people where using. These 2 really caught my eye.

## Overall opinion
Maybe I picked the wrong day but there were only a handful (10 maybe) of chefs cooking there with alot more craft beer stands and the usual folks at food festivals. Smaller than expected and pretty pricey. But I did enjoy looking at the braai's and eating the food though.
