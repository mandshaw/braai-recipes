I went to the pub today after work with Thor and we got chatting abour React, Gatsby.js, Netlify and his Gatbsy.js driven PWA for [www.thor.news](www.thor.news). I mentioned that I couple of months ago I purchased [www.braai.recipes](www.braai.recipes) because I like to "braai". [Braai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_variations_of_barbecue#South_Africa) or Braaiing is a South African style of barbeque where food (mainly meat) is cooked on an open fire (made wirh wood or charcoal, never gas) 

Any way we both work as Engineers at a well known Silicon Valley company and both love to mess around with new Technology. I mainly come from a backend, Java, SQL, ETL, Python background and him from a Web Dev background. 

I really liked Thors PWA for his site and decided I would love my site to work like that. But I don't know shit about Frontend's. (Well the work I do means I know enough to be dangerous)

I decided I will keep a log of how I built this so if nothing else one day I can look back. Read this and go "Oh shit, I completely forgot how to do this".

This is that log.

### Goal:

Build a Progressive Web App using Gatsby.js, React and Netlify to blog about tasty, delicious things I cook so that I can find the Recipes later.
