## Tips

* Always check your temp at the thickest part of the meat. Try to get the probe tip into the middle well away from any bones.
* Large pieces of meat will cook while they stand. Take your meat off 5-10°C before your target temp. 
* I use a temperature probe, most will do [this one](https://amzn.to/2TsrnnW) is quite reasonably priced.
