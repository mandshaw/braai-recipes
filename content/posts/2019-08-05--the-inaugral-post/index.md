Today we had the inaugural braai for the site! As you know a braai is a type of barbecue unique to South Africa. I still call it a braai even though in Ireland you can't get decent hardwood (It's too wet) and I use a Weber kettle. 

So somewhere someone is saying that's not a __real__ braai. But I host friends and family and drink and eat too much food cooked on a fire (never gas). It's as good as we get here.

Anyway we had Thor, who inspired kicking off this whole blog over and My soon to be brother-in-law Andy. 

On the menu was smoked mussels, prawn [sosaties](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosatie), grilled seabass and chocolate cakes.

All the recipes came from my various bbq books. I'll link which came from where and the book when I write up the ones that I liked.

Was some successful items some not so successful. Had some heat issues with my fire which was unusual. Usually I run too hot but I think I over compensated (seafood cooks **fast**). Anyway the mussels didnât open as much as I'd hoped and I didn't get a good char on my prawn sosaties.

I did modify a recipe and make a really good jalapeno and avocado dip and the seabass was delicious. The chocolate cakes are always a hit.

I'll add them as recipes soon.

Anyway we had a great time and I got the first few posts from it!
